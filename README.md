# Golang-101
Some quick starter information regarding Go.
Why did you choose this subject?
-I was captivated by the Gopher mascot but the similarity to other programming languages got me to learn more.

How were you first made aware of it?
-I searched a list of some of the most in-demand languages in 2017 based on the TIOBE index.

What problem does it solve?
-Common criticisms of other languages while maintaining their positive characteristics. 

How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?
-It is statically typed and scalable to large systems.
-Readable, without too many mandatory keywords and repetition ("light on the page" like dynamic languages).

Why does one use it?
-It also supports networking and multiprocessing.

What are the alternatives?
-There are many but where it stands out is in it's usability across many platforms.

What is it similar to, if anything?
-It has many (good) alternatives but Go is native to Google.

What is the history of this technology?
-In later interviews, all three of the language designers cited their shared dislike of C++'s complexity as a primary motivation for designing a new language.

Who built it and why?
-Created at Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.

Who is maintaining it?
-Go is free and open-source.
